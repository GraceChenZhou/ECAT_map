*	Contribution = geomarker value * geomarker coefficient
*	Total contribution = sum of four geomarker contributions
*	Rate_change = geomarker value * geomarker age coefficient
*	Overall rate_change = sum of four geomarker rate_change
*	Total effect by age = geomarker contribution + rate_change * age
