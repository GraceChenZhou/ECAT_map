# Elemental Carbon Attributable to Traffic (ECAT)

Example plots were generated based on article 'XX' 20XX. The objective is to understand the contribution of enviromental exposures and community characteristics (e.g., ECAT, deprivation index, green space, drive time to medical center) on predicting rapid lung function decline in cystic fibrosis (CF). We mainly focus on Cincinnati area because data collections were from Cincinnati Children's Hospital Medical Center, OH, USA. 

# Plot explanation

* Geomarkers: ECAT, deprivation index, green, drive time
* Rate of Change Plot refers to the impact of geomarkers on rate of change for lung function in CF. The negative value denotes the percentage predicted decline per year in lung function (often measured by FEV1% predicted)
* Total Effect Plot refers to the total effect of geomarkers on lung function in CF stratified by age stages (e.g., early, middle, late)

# Notes
* The calculation formula are recorded in xx.txt file
